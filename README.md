# Discovering Peru

Since the lockdown and the stricter rules on travelling and crossing boarders, I wanted to create a travel site based on one of my best travel experiences! At least give people some inspiration. and at best take a group with me to travel back to Peru!

 
## UX
 
- As a traveller, I want to find inspiration for a journey shedule in Peru, so that I can have a great travel experience.
- As a consumer, I want to go travel with someone who has been in the country allready, so I don't fall for the tourist traps.
- As a traveller, I want to travel in a small group of people, so I can get to know people from my own country too.
